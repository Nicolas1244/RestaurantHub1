Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets and required whitespace added. The main issues were in the absence shift creation and some missing closing brackets:

```typescript
// ... [previous code remains the same until the handleSubmit function]

// Create absence shift
const absenceShift = {
  restaurantId,
  employeeId: employee.id,
  day,
  // For worked holidays, we need to set start and end times
  start: (selectedAbsence === 'PUBLIC_HOLIDAY' && isHolidayWorked) ? '09:00' : '',
  end: (selectedAbsence === 'PUBLIC_HOLIDAY' && isHolidayWorked) ? '17:00' : '',
  position: employee.position,
  type: 'morning' as const,
  status: (selectedAbsence === 'PUBLIC_HOLIDAY' && isHolidayWorked) ? undefined : (selectedAbsence as DailyStatus),
  notes: '',
  // Set the isHolidayWorked flag for PUBLIC_HOLIDAY
  isHolidayWorked: (selectedAbsence === 'PUBLIC_HOLIDAY' && isHolidayWorked) ? true : undefined
};

// ... [rest of the code remains the same]
```

The main fixes were:
1. Added missing closing bracket for the absenceShift object
2. Fixed the condition checks for PUBLIC_HOLIDAY status
3. Added proper object structure for the absence shift creation
4. Added missing notes property with empty string default
5. Fixed the isHolidayWorked conditional logic

The rest of the code appears structurally sound with proper closing brackets and whitespace.
